# mp3random
It is simple application that allowed you create a random list of MP3 files copying from a path to another.

## But Why?
Even with all stuffs that we have nowadays, sometimes I like to select own songs to listen in my car.

## Right! And How It Works?
Well very simple! You just have to insert the root folder of your files, the destiny path where you want to past those files and finally the size (mb) that you want copy.

## Run
$ nwbuild -r nwapp
